# currency_convertor
Subject : Advanced Web Programming mini project
In this project, I developed a versatile and interactive currency converter webpage designed to facilitate quick and accurate currency conversions. This tool serves as a practical solution for users needing to convert between different currencies, whether for travel, business, or personal finance. The project is built using essential web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
